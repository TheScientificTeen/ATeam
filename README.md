Many people are misinformed about the pandemic. Due to this misinformation, many people follow wrong practices. Medical workers, with their limited resources, are struggling to help the infected. People are panic-stricken during this stressful time. This leads to the misjudgment of symptoms and unnecessary hospital visits. Doctors and medical staff are overworked and need more resources, staff and help in general. They are finding it difficult to deal with the large numbers of cases coming into the hospitals. In addition, the people are also feeling unsupported and stressed.

A-teamâ€™s proposed solution to tackle this problem was to create a website that compiles COVID-19 related data from trustworthy sources. The website is separated into three modules that each help the common man be informed of the current issues and best practices.

### Team Members

Samay is an avid computer scientist and he enjoy working with python. His role on the team was working on the idea nad presentation.

### Our Idea

After meeting the team members and discussing what each of us understood in terms of whatthe required task was, we bagn thinking seriously about the idea that we would have for this project. In order to come up with an idea, we took on a strategic approach in order to make sure that we are making the most of our time. First, we bagn by discussing initla thoughts. We asked each other if we had any idea coming into the hackathon. There was one idea that seemed prominent and this was to create an application that models infection rate due to the corona virus. This ideaa was of most interest to us because it combined many of the themes of the hackthon as well as our intersts. We did face some difficulties in deciding what exactly such a project would entail. For example, we wanted to make sure that any information we ahd opn the graph would really have the potential to impact the number of COVID-19 cases in the future and educate people about the pabndemic. We also wanted it to be accessible and include many features so that users can benefit as much as possible from it. We noted all of these idea down on a Google Document and began desining our applciation.

The main focus of our idea is the problem of publi's understanding of pandemics and, in particular, exponential growth and these models that are involved in prediciing the rate of change of infection rates. We also aim to present this information to the public in aan accurate and relevant way. Our goal is to ensure that all of the information that is placed within the website is only the main facts and fuigures which the puublic will need to see. There is an often underplayed importance to including only rleevant data. It is very importatthat we do so because  often members of the piublic atre repleed from visiting websites which contain small font and too much information including complicated statistics. This massively reduces the number of viewers and prevents the goal ofeducating the public from being achieved. Additionally, we are achieveing a somewhat different purspose in comaprison to these larger organizatuions. N particular, we are focusing only on the average individual tnot a scientist or a politician. The vast majority of the human politiiciado not fall into any of these  categories and so we want to mke sure we appeal and inform this majority. We do through a number of ways.

Our idea is heavily reliant on modules. What we mean by this is that there is no one overarching systrem which overshadows all of the machnisms of the websotes. Instead, we have three main sections. The first section is  the important facts and figures section. This includes 4 key statistics that all individuals should be interested in, no more. These statistics are the number of cases, the number of deaths, the number of recoveries and the current number of active cases. Below this section,  we have our second section. This is the graph of the infection rate (daily cases) globally. Often, people are interested in what is cccurring in the world around them rather than just their own countries. tHI sis because it is not possible for their situation to return to normal if the entire worl dhas not yet. The final section of the website is arguably the mopst important and the most customised to the user. It is teh chat bot that we have created which allows the user to get accurate information from trusted web sources which we have connected to the chatbot through python. The suer can input any question that they have and they will receive the relevant information. For this, we have utilised artificial intelligence in order to make sure that the bot can recognise what the user is typing and then relay correct and relplevant infoirmation.

### Functionality

In order to present the functionaility of our project, we will provide an example of a situation in which a user will use our website and what they will expect to see. The user will begin by entering the URL of the website and being redirected to the website homepage. There they will see the firts two sections of the project: key statsistics and the graph.

They will be able to look through the 4 numbers which are the statistics that will be relevant to a general member of the public. They will immediately understand what they mean because irrleevant information is excludded and then they will be able to move on to the next section. In the next section, they will look at a graph. This graph has an x-axis and y-axis, of course. On the y-axis we have number of daily cases (on the dya that the user vists the website). This is a godo measure of infection rate and it gives the user a good idea of the progress of the situation. On the x-axis is time and this will inform the reader about how long it will probably take until the situation reaches a certain point given the current trend over time. \Te user will then progress on to the next section, feeling satisfied with the informartion that they have received so far.

The user will then progress onto section 3. This is the chatr bot section. BAsed on the ifnromation that the ser has seen, they may have questions. These questions will be specific to them and thei rlikelihood of being infected for example or just general information that they wish to find our about the virus. Unfortnatly, they do not want gto search on the web or other websiotes as they are uncertain about the reliability of tehse sources and are often frustrated by the ciomplexity and lack of relevance of teh information that they see. Instead, they use our AI-powered chatbot feature in order to ask a question. Once the question has been asked, iour AI using machine learning techniques in order to interpret the question and output a result. The user will read the information, understand it, then ask any other questions that they have. They will lasty leave the website confident about the knowledge that they have acuqired regardijg the situation and encouraged to comply with the regulations because they feel more reassured that they are not being lied to.

### Code

Please see the screenshots and video below to understand the code that we wrote for this project.

### Evaluation

Our project is successful because it achieves the aim we et out to achieve about educating the public concisely regarding the pandemic and encouraging them to follow regulations. We also focused on the mathematics, health and machine learning themes which are central to our project. In order to improve the project in the future, we wil have more add-ons which we believe are very feasible.
